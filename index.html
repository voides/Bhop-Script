You want to be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you want to be bad

It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it

They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't want to be a boy, you want to be a man
You want to stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it

You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they beat you,
Then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you want to be bad

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it

			<h3>How Does It Work?</h3>

			<p class="text-justify">Instead of making you download AutoHotkey and then downloading a script that will only work on flat surfaces,
			I've made my script in Visual Studio. Unfortunately, it will only work on Windows (sorry Mac users), and you will need <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42642" target="_blank">Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2</a>
			or higher for it to work. The script works by using external cues on your PC while playing CS:GO to jump. Instead of injecting into CS:GO, or having the need to
			require numerous .dll files, it reads keystrokes, sound, and cursor movement while you hold down space. This is so the script can't get detected. 
			No information from your computer will be sent anywhere, you wouldn't be able to use this offline if that was the case.</p>

			<br>

			<h3>Is It Detected By VAC?</h3>

			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/voides/Bhop-Script/gh-pages/images/CSGOVACBan.png" alt="CS:GO VAC Ban Message" style="width:600px" id="VAC">

			<p class="text-justify"><strong>No.</strong> This can't be detected by VAC, even though it's a .exe program. The reason why, is because the script only modifies
			your keystrokes. It doesn't change the game at all. Which means that no offset updates, or CS:GO updates will stop the script from working.
			As long as you have "+jump" bound to space, you're good to go.</p>

		<br>

			<h3>Can I Get Banned?</h3>

			<p class="text-justify"><strong>Yes.</strong> It is possible, but it will <strong>not</strong> be a VAC ban. Whenever you cheat, there is always a chance you will be banned. But if you use the script appropriately, you don't have
			to worry as much, or even at all. The only way you can get banned using this, is through the <a href="http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/overwatch/" target="_blank">CS:GO Overwatch System</a>.
			But, like I said earlier, if you use the script properly, you don't have to worry as much about being banned.</p>

			<br>
			
			<h3>How Do I Know If It's On?</h3>
			
			<p>Depending on the speed of your computer, you will hear a single beep to indicate that the script is active. You have to leave it
			open for it to keep working. I'll work on a way to inject the script into a different process like Skype or Steam so you can close the
			program and still have the script on. But until then, you'll have to keep it open.</p>
			
			<h3>What Do The Different Modes Do?</h3>
			
			<p>I've included 3 different styles of bhopping into this script. Here's what they do:</p>
			
			<ul id="modes">
			
				<li>Regular: All this does is make you jump as soon as you hit the ground. It only jumps once, so this style would be used on Valve hosted servers.</li>
				
				<li>Scroll: This style is for CEVO, ESEA, Face It, or any other 3rd party platform. Simulates scrolling, so it appears as if you are scrolling to bhop if your
				commands and inputs are being checked by server admins.</li>
				
				<li>Rage: This is probably the least expected mode to be on a bhop script. Basically this mode bhops perfectly for you every time. If there is no speed
				limit on the server, you will pass it since the script will land a perfect bhop every time. The other 2 styles make sure you don't go above 320 since that is
				the max speed on most CS:GO servers. This mode should not be used on Valve servers, since it <strong>will</strong> cause an Untrusted Account Ban.
				It's fine to use anywhere else though.</li>
				
			</ul>
			
			<br>
			
			<h3>Is It Safe For My Computer?</h3>

			<p class="text-justify"><span id="yes-safe"><strong>Yes, this program is 100% safe.</strong></span> Sadly, it <em>will</em> show up as a virus on your computer. But this is only because I didn't use
			an application protector on it. If you want to be sure it's safe to use, decompile the code and see for yourself. Obviously, if you don't want to
			download the script, you don't have to.</p>
			<p class="text-justify">Please <strong>DO NOT</strong> use virustotal to back up your claim that this is a virus. Virustotal has been giving my programs false
			positives for as long as I've been making them. I can even run a blank program through it and it'll still get flagged.
			Unless you are experiencing weird things on your computer after you download this, then don't say anything. It gets really annoying,
			and I may remove or block your comments from my channel if you continue to spread false information about the script.</p>

			<p>I guarantee none of you use any of these antivirus applications. You've probably not even heard of them outside of Virustotal. Maybe Symantec could be the only exception, 
			but that's about it. So unless you weird things are happening to your computer, don't complain in the comments about this being a virus. It'll only be removed.</p>

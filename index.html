			<h3>How Does It Work?</h3>

			<p>Instead of making you download AutoHotkey and then downloading a script that will only work on flat surfaces,
			I've made my script in Visual Studio. Unfortunately, it will only work on Windows (sorry Mac users), and you will need <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42642" target="_blank">Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2</a>
			or higher for it to work. The script works by using external cues on your PC while playing CS:GO to jump. Instead of injecting into CS:GO, or having the need to
			require numerous .dll files, it reads keystrokes, sound, and cursor movement while you hold down space. This is so the script can't get detected. 
			No information from your computer will be sent anywhere, you wouldn't be able to use this offline if that was the case.</p>

			<br>

			<h3>Is It Detected By VAC?</h3>

			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/voides/Bhop-Script/gh-pages/images/CSGOVACBan.png" alt="CS:GO VAC Ban Message" style="width:600px" id="VAC">

			<p><strong>No.</strong> This can't be detected by VAC, even though it's a .exe program. The reason why, is because the script only modifies
			your keystrokes. It doesn't change the game at all. Which means that no offset updates, or CS:GO updates will stop the script from working.
			As long as you have "+jump" bound to space, you're good to go.</p>

		<br>

			<h3>Can I Get Banned?</h3>

			<p><strong>Yes.</strong> It is possible, but it will <strong>not</strong> be a VAC ban. Whenever you cheat, there is always a chance you will be banned. But if you use the script appropriately, you don't have
			to worry as much, or even at all. The only way you can get banned using this, is through the <a href="http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/overwatch/" target="_blank">CS:GO Overwatch System</a>.
			But, like I said earlier, if you use the script properly, you don't have to worry as much about being banned.</p>

			<br>

			<h3>Is It Safe For My Computer?</h3>

			<p><span id="yes-safe"><strong>Yes, this program is 100% safe.</strong></span> Sadly, it <em>will</em> show up as a virus on your computer. But this is only because I didn't use
			an application protector on it. If you want to be sure it's safe to use, decompile the code and see for yourself. But if you don't want to
			download the script, you don't have to.</p>
			<p>Please <strong>DO NOT</strong> use virustotal to back up your claim that this is a virus. Virustotal has been giving my programs false
			positives for as long as I've been making them. I can even run a blank program through it and it'll still get flagged.
			Unless you are experiencing weird things on your computer after you download this, then don't say anything. It gets really annoying,
			and I may remove or block your comments from my channel if you continue to spread false information about the script.</p>

	  <h3 class="headers">How Does It Work?</h3>
	  <p class="p-center">Instead of making you download AutoHotkey and then downloading a script that will only work on flat surfaces,
	  I've made my script in Visual Studio. Unfortunately, it will only work on Windows (sorry Mac users), and you will need <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42642">Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2</a>
	  or higher for it to work. The script works by using external cues on your PC while playing CS:GO to jump. Instead of injecting into CS:GO, or having the need to
	  require numerous .dll files, it reads keystrokes, sound, and cursor movement while you hold down space. This is so the script can't get detected, 
	  no information from your computer will be sent anywhere. You wouldn't be able to use it offline if that was happening.</p>
	  <br>
	  <h3 class="headers">Is It Safe?</h3>
	  <p class="p-center"><span id="yes-safe"><strong>Yes, this program is 100% safe.</strong></span> Sadly, it <em>will</em> show up as a virus on your computer. But this is only because I didn't use
	  an application protector on it. If you want to be sure it's safe to use, decompile the code and see for yourself. But if you don't want to
	  download the script, you don't have to.</p>
